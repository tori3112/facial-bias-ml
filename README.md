# Ethnic Bias in Face Recognition Investigation

This repository documents a project for the Machine Learning course ([KU Leuven Syllabus](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/T44MLEE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp978576)) taken in the Winter Semester of the 2024/2025 academic year.

**Project Goal:** To investigate, analyze, and potentially mitigate ethnic biases present in face recognition models. This project specifically focuses on how race can affect the fairness and accuracy of these models.

**Key Areas of Investigation:**

* Analysis of facial datasets for racial imbalances.
* Evaluation of face recognition models for performance disparities across different ethnic groups.
* Experimentation with bias mitigation techniques to improve fairness.

**Repository Structure:**
* **`data/`**: Contains facial datasets used for the investigation.
* **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data analysis, model evaluation, and bias mitigation experiments.
* **`utils/`**: Any Python source code used outside of the notebooks.
* **`reports/`**: All reports and presentations summarizing the project findings.
* **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
* **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python package dependencies.

> Important Note:
The original dataset is VGGFace2 dataset with MIVIA Ethnicity Recognition labels. Based on that set, we have created subsets for our investigation.
